# Vanilla Rubies (Rubies and Trades)
Curseforge would not let me call the mod vanilla rubies. But I like the name vanilla rubies more than rubies and trades,
so it will  still be called vanilla rubies here and in the code of the mod.

Adds new ruby item, ruby ore, ruby block, and new villager level with ruby trades.
